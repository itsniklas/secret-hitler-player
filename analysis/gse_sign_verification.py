"""GSE/GSIR sign-convention verification.

Motivation: there is an apparent disconnect between the reported GSIR in
Table 1 (which appears to show deleterious effects on team when fascist)
and the superior performance in fascist roles. One would have to conclude
that the Llama 3.3 fascist partner has a strong positive GSIR or that
Llama 3.3 liberals always have a very negative GSIR. This script
determines whether there is a bug in the reported GSIR (e.g. the GSE not
being properly negated).

This script traces GSIR for N fascist-winning games (default 5) from a
given run directory. For each game we print, per turn:

  * round, president-id, chancellor-id, enacted policy
  * liberal-perspective gameStateScore (as logged; positive = good for libs)
  * Alice's team-relative gameStateScore (= +score if Alice liberal; -score
    if Alice fascist or hitler)  ← this is the sign convention used by
    eval/gamestats.py:415 and analysis/bootstrap_ci.py
  * the per-turn delta (next − this) of the team-relative score, with
    an "*" marker on turns where Alice was president or chancellor
    (i.e., contributed to GSIR)

At the end of each game we print: Alice's role, the game's winner, the
sum of Alice's *team-relative* action deltas (Alice GSIR_total), and the
sign of that sum.

Expected on a fascist-winning game where Alice is fascist/hitler:
    GSIR_total should be POSITIVE (Alice took actions that moved the
    game toward her side's win). A persistently negative sum on
    fascist wins would indicate the sign flip is wrong.

Usage:
    python -m analysis.gse_sign_verification <runs-dir> [--n 5] [--out FILE]

`runs-dir` should be one of the runsF2-* folders. The canonical choice is
`runsF2-LLAMA3370B` (the 100-game Llama 3.3 70B run); it can also be
pointed at any other F2 dir as a smoke test.
